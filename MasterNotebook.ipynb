This will be different, because you'll have taken images on a different day at the very least, so just change it.

    "You read in the data by using `photData = Table.read('photometry/simple.ecsv)`. From there, you can access the data that we found. There's a column, `time` which has datetime strings that are pretty funky and we can't use to plot, so for your x-axis you'll need to get just the numeric times out of there. There's a function you can import from the utils package to convert them, if you just pass it the data table you have: `times = genTimesFromTable(photData)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you can get the fluxes by simply referencing the data with the name of the star you want, for example, if I wanted the y-data to plot flux vs time for my target, I would get it from `photData['target'].data`. Because the data is stored in an astropy table, just using `photData['target']` would give us a subtable with the header type info, which we can probably still plot, but just to be safe I like to extract an array of the values with the `.data` property.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all that said, I could then plot the data in the way that I am most familiar with.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do the differential part, we can use either (or both) of two ways; relative flux, and magnitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to compute the magnitude difference between two stars, there is a function in the utils package `diffMag(flux1,flux2)` that will give you that.  For the relative flux, simply divide the flux of the star you want (probably the target) by the flux of your other comparison star. if you have numpy arrays, it will handle the element-wise stuff automatically and you can just have `relative_flux = flux1/flux2` in your code."
