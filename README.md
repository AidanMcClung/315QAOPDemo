# 315QAOPDemo
An early example of how to use the QAOP code and it's functionality.

## This code is not what you should be using. 

**If you're here, you're in the wrong place.** 

**Head over to https://github.com/AidanMcClung/QAOP instead**



The Code and modules are in the QAOP.zip file, but THEY NEED TO BE UNZIPPED TO BE USED!
You can put the unzipped file wherever you'd like, but you'll need to be able to copy the path to it.

Everything should be explained in the MASTER notebook. The name codeDemo is old and I forgot to change it, and it really only demos the photometry code, which is also in the master notebook. Start with the master notebook basically is what you should do.
