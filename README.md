# 315QAOPDemo
An example of how to use the QAOP code, and also a place to get that code itself.

The Code and modules are in the QAOP.zip file, but THEY NEED TO BE UNZIPPED TO BE USED!
You can put the unzipped file wherever you'd like, but you'll need to be able to copy the path to it.

Everything should be explained in the MASTER notebook. The name codeDemo is old and I forgot to change it, and it really only demos the photometry code, which is also in the master notebook. Start with the master notebook basically is what you should do.
